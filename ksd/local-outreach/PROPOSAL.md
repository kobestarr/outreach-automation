# Local Business Outreach Handover

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Status:** Ready for Agent Execution  
**Goal:** Book qualified local business owners into calls, sell into tiered pricing, collect setup fees quickly

---

## Executive Summary

Core idea: Sell business outcomes, not marketing tasks. Package into simple ladder of commitment with paid buy-in from day one.

**Pricing Psychology:**
- Everyone pays something upfront
- Signals value, filters time-wasters
- Sets expectation for responsiveness

---

## Pricing Structure (Locked)

### Tier 1: Essential
- **Setup:** £47
- **Monthly:** £197
- **Why:** Low setup removes friction, prevents freebie seekers. Monthly signals value.
- **Fit:** "Need more leads, not ready for big rebuild"

### Tier 2: Growth
- **Setup:** £997
- **Monthly:** £297
- **Why:** Setup creates immediate profit + commitment. Middle tier for serious businesses.
- **Fit:** "Want proper plan and execution, leads + conversion improvements"

### Tier 3: Expansion
- **Setup:** £2,997 (includes website rebuild)
- **Monthly:** £497
- **Why:** Big setup cash justified by concrete asset. Monthly keeps rebuild alive.
- **Fit:** "Website is old, slow, embarrassing, or not converting"

### Tier 4: Authority (Personal Brand)
- **Setup:** £5,997 - £9,997
- **Monthly:** £497 - £697
- **Why:** Premium positioning for founders wanting category leader status.
- **Fit:** "Want to be known locally, win higher-ticket clients"

### Tier 5: Empire (Business Growth)
- **Setup:** £7,997 - £14,997 (full systems + website)
- **Monthly:** £797 - £997
- **Why:** Growth infrastructure, not marketing tasks. Systems + execution.
- **Fit:** "Want predictable lead flow, system, and someone owning growth"

## Selling Approach

**Do NOT pitch tiers first.** Diagnose bottleneck, then match tier.

| Bottleneck | Tier |
|------------|------|
| "Just need someone to get this moving" | Tier 1 |
| "Tried stuff before, want proper plan" | Tier 2 |
| "Website is the problem" | Tier 3 |
| "I am the brand, need authority" | Tier 4 |
| "Want growth infrastructure and execution" | Tier 5 |

## Messaging Principles

Outreach message is NOT "we do websites". It is:

> "You are losing money because X is broken. We fix X quickly, with a paid starting point, then we build momentum."

---

## MVP Scope (Week 1-2)

### 1. Lead Magnet (Build ONE first)
**Concept:** "Local Growth Fix List"
- 1-page PDF or Notion page
- Promise: "10 fixes that increase calls and bookings in 7 days"
- Universal across local niches

### 2. Week 1 Niche: Home Services
**Why:**
- Clear transactional demand and pain
- Higher LTV per customer
- Owners care about calls/bookings, not vanity metrics
- Many have weak sites + no follow-up system → Perfect for Tier 2/3

### 3. MVP Pipeline
- Source leads (Google Maps, local directories, Yelp)
- Capture: business name, email, website, phone, category, location
- Basic enrichment: website present? booking form? obvious issues?
- Generate personalized opener line (lightweight rule-set)
- Send sequence through existing sending stack
- Track replies and book calls

### 4. Email Sending: Manual Approval First
Why:
- Prevent deliverability mistakes
- Prevent personalisation errors
- Refine messaging fast based on responses
- Quality beats volume in first 100 sends

After proof (week 2+): Automate first line, keep spot-checking

---

## Monday Morning Checklist

- [ ] Lock Week 1 niche: home services
- [ ] Build 200-lead list in 2-4 local areas
- [ ] Run first 100 sends with manual approval
- [ ] Track replies and classify:
  - Interested now
  - Interested later
  - Not a fit
  - Referral possible
- [ ] Run calls using bottleneck mapping to tier
- [ ] Close with "start paid" framing:
  > "We start with the setup, we ship the first fixes within 7 days, then we keep improving monthly."

## Non-Negotiables

- ❌ Do NOT offer free audits
- ❌ Do NOT remove Tier 1 setup fee
- ❌ Do NOT pitch websites as the product (pitch outcomes + bottlenecks)
- ❌ Do NOT scale volume until messaging converts

---

## Notes

Copy and outreach angle can be refined based on responses. The framework is proven.
