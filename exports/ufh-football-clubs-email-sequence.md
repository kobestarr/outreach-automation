## Email 1 — Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** your players

**Body:**

Hi there,

I'm reaching out from the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast — we work with the bestselling kids book series (over 1 million copies sold).

We'd love to get your players involved. Here's the idea:

Any of your players can send in a voice note to the podcast. If it gets picked to be read out, they get a free Ultimate Football Heroes book sent to them. Kids love hearing themselves on a real podcast and the books are brilliant for getting them reading.

We'd also love to feature your club. We're running a segment where coaches and club leaders can leave a voice note talking about how proud they are of their players and teams. It's a great way to give your club a shout-out to thousands of young football fans.

If you're up for it, I can send over the details on how to get your players' voice notes in.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Kobi

## Email 2 — Follow-up 1 (Day 3)

**Subject:** voice notes

**Body:**

Hi again,

Quick follow-up on the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast idea.

The voice note thing is dead simple — kids just record a short clip on a phone (30 seconds to a minute) talking about their favourite footballer or a moment from their own match. The best ones get read out on the podcast and the player gets a free book posted to them.

It works really well as a fun thing to do at the end of a training session or in a WhatsApp group with parents.

Happy to send you everything you'd need to share with your players and parents if you're interested.

## Email 3 — Follow-up 2 (Day 7)

**Subject:** quick one

**Body:**

Hi,

One more from me about the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast.

As well as the kids' voice notes, we're keen to feature grassroots clubs and coaches directly. If you or any of your coaches fancied recording a short voice note talking about your team — a standout moment from the season, a player who's come on loads, anything you're proud of — we'd love to include it in an upcoming episode.

It's a nice bit of recognition for the work you do and the kids get a buzz hearing their club mentioned on a podcast.

No pressure at all — just thought it could be a good fit.

## Email 4 — Breakup (Day 21)

**Subject:** last one from me

**Body:**

Hi,

I've sent a couple of emails about the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast and getting your players involved — I'll leave it here.

If the timing's ever better or you want to get your club featured, the door's always open. Just reply to this email and I'll send everything over.

All the best for the rest of the season.

## Notes

- **No merge variables needed** — same copy for every club
- **Tone:** Friendly, peer-level, no sales language. This is giving something away, not selling.
- **Subject lines:** 2-3 words, lowercase, internal-looking (per cold email skill data)
- **CTA:** Interest-based ("what do you think?", "if you're interested") — not asking for a meeting
- **Framework:** PPP (Praise, Picture, Push) adapted — the "praise" is implicit respect for grassroots football, the "picture" is kids hearing themselves on a podcast, the "push" is gentle
- **Breakup email honours the close** — no further contact after email 4
- **Word count:** Email 1 ~160w, Email 2 ~120w, Email 3 ~120w, Email 4 ~70w (all within optimal range)
