# UFH Football Clubs — Email Outreach Sequences

---

## Sequence A: Greater Manchester + East Cheshire Clubs

**Campaign:** ufh-football-clubs (via Mailead)
**Target:** Youth football clubs & academies across Greater Manchester + East Cheshire
**Emails:** 3 (initial + follow-up + breakup)
**Cadence:** Day 0 → Day 3 → Day 7

---

### Email 1 — Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** your players

**Body:**

Hi there,

I'm reaching out from the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast — we work with the bestselling kids book series (over 1 million copies sold).

We're reaching out to clubs across Greater Manchester and East Cheshire right now — before we go nationwide — and we'd love to get your players involved.

Here's the idea: any of your players can send in a voice note to the podcast. If it gets picked to be read out, they get a free Ultimate Football Heroes book sent to them. Kids love hearing themselves on a real podcast and the books are brilliant for getting them reading.

We'd also love to feature your club — coaches and club leaders can leave a voice note talking about their teams and players. It's a great way to give your club a shout-out to thousands of young football fans.

This is the best window for your club to get featured over the next few weeks before we open it up to everyone.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Kobi

### Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** voice notes

**Body:**

Hi again,

Quick follow-up on the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast.

The voice note thing is dead simple — kids just record a short clip on a phone (30 seconds to a minute) talking about their favourite footballer or a moment from their own match. The best ones get read out on the podcast and the player gets a free book posted to them.

It works really well as a fun thing to do at the end of a training session or in a WhatsApp group with parents.

Happy to send you everything you'd need to share with your players and parents.

### Email 3 — Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject:** last one from me

**Body:**

Hi,

Last email from me about the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast.

If you or any of your coaches fancied recording a short voice note talking about your team — a standout moment, a player who's come on loads, anything you're proud of — we'd love to include it in an upcoming episode. It's a nice bit of recognition for the work you do.

No worries if the timing's not right. The door's always open — just reply to this email whenever suits.

All the best for the rest of the season.

## Sequence B: Chelsea-Area Clubs

**Campaign:** ufh-chelsea-area-clubs (via Mailead)
**Target:** Youth football clubs & academies near Stamford Bridge / West London
**Emails:** 3 (initial + follow-up + breakup)
**Cadence:** Day 0 → Day 3 → Day 7

---

### Email 1 — Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** a Chelsea fan

**Body:**

Hi there,

I'm reaching out from the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast — we work with the bestselling kids book series (over 1 million copies sold).

One of our listeners, a young girl called Lexi, sent in a voice note to the podcast a little while back. This weekend, she was the mascot at Chelsea — walked out at Stamford Bridge in front of thousands. We thought clubs near Chelsea would love to hear that story.

We'd love to get your players involved too. Any of your kids can send in a voice note to the podcast — talking about their favourite footballer or a moment from their own match. If it gets picked to be read out, they get a free Ultimate Football Heroes book sent to them.

We're reaching out to clubs local to Chelsea right now and we'd love to feature yours. Coaches and club leaders can leave a voice note too — it's a great way to give your club a shout-out to thousands of young football fans.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Kobi

## Notes (both sequences)

- **No merge variables needed** — same copy for every club
- **Tone:** Friendly, peer-level, no sales language. This is giving something away, not selling.
- **Subject lines:** 2-3 words, lowercase, internal-looking
- **CTA:** Interest-based ("what do you think?") — not asking for a meeting
- **Breakup email honours the close** — no further contact after email 3
- **Word count:** Email 1 ~170w, Email 2 ~100w, Email 3 ~90w (all within optimal range)
- **Key difference:** Sequence B (Chelsea) leads with the Lexi mascot story as social proof
