**Emails:** 3 (initial + follow-up + breakup)
**Cadence:** Day 0 → Day 3 → Day 7

### Email 1 — Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** free Ultimate Football Heroes books for your players

**Body:**

Hi there,

I'm reaching out from the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast. We work with the bestselling kids book series (over 1 million copies sold).

We're reaching out to clubs across Greater Manchester and East Cheshire right now, before we go nationwide, and we'd love to get your players involved.

Here's the idea: any of your players can send in a voice note to the podcast. We only feature one or two per episode, but if theirs gets picked they get a free Ultimate Football Heroes book sent to them.

Kids love hearing themselves on a real podcast and the books are brilliant for getting them reading.

One of our listeners, an 8-year-old called Lexi, sent in a voice note and ended up walking out as the mascot at Chelsea vs Burnley in front of 40,000 fans. She called it "the best day ever."

We'd also love to feature {{company_name}}. Coaches and club leaders can leave a voice note talking about their teams and players. It's a great way to give your club a shout-out to thousands of young football fans.

This is the best window for {{company_name}} to get featured over the next few weeks before we open it up to everyone.

What do you think?

You can find the podcast by searching "Ultimate Football Heroes" on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or YouTube.

Cheers,
Kobi

### Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 3)

**Subject:** voice notes

**Body:**

Hi again,

Quick follow-up on the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast.

The voice note thing is dead simple.

Kids just record a short clip on a phone (30 seconds to a minute) talking about their favourite footballer or a moment from their own match.

The best ones get read out on the podcast and the player gets a free book posted to them.

It works really well as a fun thing to do at the end of a training session or in a WhatsApp group with parents.

Happy to send you everything you'd need to share with your players and parents.

### Email 3 — Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject:** last one from me

**Body:**

Hi,

Last email from me about the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast.

If you or any of your coaches fancied recording a short voice note talking about {{company_name}}, a standout moment, a player who's come on loads, anything you're proud of, we'd love to include it in an upcoming episode.

It's a nice bit of recognition for the work you do.

No worries if the timing's not right. The door's always open, just reply to this email whenever suits.

All the best for the rest of the season.

## Sequence B: Chelsea-Area Clubs

**Campaign:** ufh-chelsea-area-clubs (via Mailead)
**Target:** Youth football clubs & academies near Stamford Bridge / West London
**Emails:** 3 (initial + follow-up + breakup)
**Cadence:** Day 0 → Day 3 → Day 7

### Email 1 — Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** free Ultimate Football Heroes books for your players

**Body:**

Hi there,

I'm reaching out from the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast. We work with the bestselling kids book series (over 1 million copies sold).

One of our listeners, an 8-year-old called Lexi from London, sent in a voice note to the podcast a while back.

This weekend, she was the mascot at Chelsea vs Burnley. Walked out onto the pitch at Stamford Bridge with Trevor Chalobah in front of 40,000 fans.

She called it "the best day ever."

We thought clubs near Chelsea would love to hear that story.

We'd love to get your players involved too. Any of your kids can send in a voice note to the podcast talking about their favourite footballer or a moment from their own match.

We only feature one or two per episode, but if theirs gets picked they get a free Ultimate Football Heroes book sent to them.

We're reaching out to clubs local to Chelsea right now and we'd love to feature {{company_name}}. Coaches and club leaders can leave a voice note too. It's a great way to give your club a shout-out to thousands of young football fans.

What do you think?

You can find the podcast by searching "Ultimate Football Heroes" on Spotify, Apple Podcasts or YouTube.

That's how Lexi's voice note started, and she ended up high-fiving Cole Palmer and walking out in front of 40,000 people.

## Notes (both sequences)

- **Merge variable:** `{{company_name}}` from Mailead CSV `company_name` column.
- **Tone:** Friendly, peer-level, no sales language. This is giving something away, not selling.
- **Subject lines:** Email 1 leads with the free book offer. Follow-ups are short and internal-looking.
- **CTA:** Interest-based ("what do you think?"), not asking for a meeting.
- **Breakup email honours the close.** No further contact after email 3.
- **Key difference:** Sequence A (GM) mentions Lexi briefly as proof. Sequence B (Chelsea) leads with the full Lexi story as the hook.
