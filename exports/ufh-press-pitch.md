**Subject:** Chelsea mascot started as a podcast voice note

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick story I thought you might like.

A young girl called Lexi has been listening to the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast — the one based on the bestselling kids book series (over 1 million copies sold). She sent in a voice note to the show a little while back, which got read out on an episode.

This weekend, Lexi was the mascot at Chelsea. Walked out at Stamford Bridge in front of thousands.

It's a lovely grassroots story — a kid who loves football, gets involved with a podcast that's getting children reading through the sport, and then gets to live a dream day at a Premier League ground.

We have the clip from the episode if you'd like to use it, and we're happy to chat about the podcast and how we're working with grassroots clubs across the country to get kids involved.

We're currently running a campaign across Greater Manchester and East Cheshire — reaching out to local youth football clubs to get their players sending in voice notes — before taking it nationwide.

Happy to send over more detail, photos, or set up a quick call if it's something you'd cover.

Best,
Kobi Omenaka
Ultimate Football Heroes Podcast
