## Email 1 — Initial (Day 0)

**Subject:** lexi's voice note

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

An 8-year-old Chelsea fan called Lexi sent a voice note to the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast and ended up walking out as mascot at Stamford Bridge. Here's the voice note, and here's the full episode (Lexi's moment is at 5:15).

I'm Kobi Omenaka, producer of the official tie-in podcast to the ultra-popular Ultimate Football Heroes book series (3m+ copies sold). The podcast is on Apple, Spotify and YouTube, and coming soon to Yoto. We're always looking for young fans to send in their voice notes. Every child whose message gets played on the show receives a free book.

Lexi's already asked for the Cole Palmer one.

If that's something worth sharing with your audience, happy to send photos, clips, or connect you with the UFH team. Worth a mention?

Best,
Kobi

## Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 3-4)

**Subject:** re: lexi's voice note

**Body:**

Hi {{firstName}},

Quick follow-up on Lexi's story. Since that email, we've had dozens more kids sending in voice notes wanting to be on the show. It's becoming a proper thing.

If the timing isn't right for this one, no worries at all. What's the best way to keep you in the loop for future stories?

Best,
Kobi

## Notes

- **Merge variable:** `{{firstName}}` from PressRanger data (journalist first name)
- **Subject line:** Lowercase, personal, story-driven — passes the "internal email" test
- **Follow-up subject:** "re:" prefix makes it look like a reply thread — higher open rate
- **No breakup email** — 2-touch sequence only for press (journalists are busier, less is more)
- **Links needed:** Voice note clip URL + full episode URL (with timestamp 5:15)
- **Podcast contacts need different greeting** — firstName = show name, not a person
