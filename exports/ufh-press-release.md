## Young Podcast Listener Walks Out as Chelsea Mascot After Voice Note Inspires Thousands

**London / Manchester, February 2026** — Lexi, a young football fan and listener of the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast, was selected as the matchday mascot at Chelsea this weekend — walking out at Stamford Bridge in front of thousands of fans.

Lexi had previously sent in a voice note to the podcast, which was read out on a recent episode. The Ultimate Football Heroes podcast, based on the bestselling children's book series that has sold over 1 million copies worldwide, invites young football fans to send in voice notes sharing their favourite footballing moments, opinions on their heroes, and stories from their own matches.

"Lexi's story is exactly what this podcast is about," said Kobi Omenaka, host of the Ultimate Football Heroes podcast. "Kids getting involved, having their voices heard, and falling even more in love with football. The fact that she then got to walk out at Chelsea is incredible — but it started with a 30-second voice note on a phone."

The podcast is currently running a grassroots campaign across Greater Manchester and East Cheshire, working with local youth football clubs to get their players sending in voice notes. Children whose voice notes are featured on the show receive a free Ultimate Football Heroes book — combining a love of football with reading.

"We're starting locally before going nationwide," added Omenaka. "We want to give clubs in this area the first chance to get their players featured. The response from grassroots coaches has been brilliant — they love that it gets kids reading and gives their club a shout-out to thousands of listeners."

The Ultimate Football Heroes book series, published by Bonnier Books, tells the stories of the world's greatest footballers and has been credited with getting a generation of reluctant readers — particularly boys — engaged with books.
