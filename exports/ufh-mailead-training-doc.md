## Voice Notes — How It Works

We invite kids to send in voice notes to the podcast. Here's how:

- Any child can record a short voice note (30 seconds to a minute) on a phone
- They can talk about their favourite footballer, a memorable match moment, or anything football-related
- They can also share goals, saves, birthdays, or match milestones
- Voice notes should be emailed to ufhpodcast@gmail.com
- We feature one or two voice notes per episode
- Every child whose voice note is played on the show receives a free Ultimate Football Heroes book of their choice
- Coaches and club leaders can also record voice notes talking about their club, standout players, or proud moments

## The Lexi Story

One of our listeners, an 8-year-old Chelsea fan called Lexi, sent in a voice note to the podcast. She ended up being selected as the mascot at Chelsea vs Burnley at Stamford Bridge, walking out in front of 40,000 fans with Trevor Chalobah. She called it "the best day ever." She's asked for the Cole Palmer book as her free copy.
