      "body": "Hi Kailesh and Callum,\n\nI noticed Kiss Dental Bramhall doesn't seem to have much of a social presence yet.\n\nWith 83 five-star reviews, you've clearly got happy patients - but if someone's searching for a dentist on Instagram or Facebook, they might not find you.\n\nI help practices get set up properly online so new patients can actually find you and understand what you offer. I've worked with everyone from local salons to Twiggy, and I'm just down the road in Poynton.\n\nFrom just £97 I can get your basics sorted - profile setup, key info visible, that kind of thing.\n\nWorth a quick chat? Book 15 mins here: [calendar link]\n\nI wasn't sure which of you would be the best person to speak with about this, so I'm reaching out to everyone. Hope that's okay!\n\nPlease let me know which one of you is the best to chat with regarding this.\n\nSent from my iPhone"
