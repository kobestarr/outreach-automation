# Micro-Offer Outreach System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** February 8, 2026
**Status:** Active

---

## Part 1: Overview

### What is the Micro-Offer System?

The micro-offer system is a low-barrier entry point for local businesses to experience your service before committing to the full monthly package. Instead of asking for a £500/month commitment upfront, you offer a £97 "taster" that solves a specific problem or delivers immediate value.

**Philosophy:** Write like a busy business owner reaching out to a peer, not a marketer pitching a stranger. The best cold emails feel like one local business owner helping another, not a sales pitch.

**UK-First Approach:** Designed for UK market with British English, local references, and appropriate pricing. Adaptable to US, AU, CA, NZ, and EU markets with currency localization.

### Key Components

1. **Category-Specific Angles** — 11 industry groups with tailored messaging
2. **Observation Signals** — 6 data-driven hooks for personalization
3. **20 Email Rules** — Copywriting system for busy business owner tone
4. **18 LinkedIn Rules** — Professional but warm LinkedIn outreach
5. **Currency Localization** — Pricing adapted to UK/US/AU/CA/NZ/EU

## Part 2: Email System — 20 Rules

These rules ensure emails feel like they're from a busy business owner, not a marketer.

### The 20 Rules

1. **Write like a busy business owner, not a marketer**
   You're a peer helping another business owner, not selling them something.

2. **No buzzwords, jargon, or corporate speak**
   Avoid: synergy, leverage, circle back, thought leader, game-changer, cutting-edge, innovative.

3. **Keep emails under 100 words (4-5 sentences max)**
   Busy people don't read long emails. Get to the point.

4. **Use lowercase subject lines (feels less sales-y)**
   ✅ "quick question about your salon"
   ❌ "Quick Question About Your Salon"

5. **Lead with specific observation, not generic pleasantry**
   ✅ "I noticed you've got 8 reviews on Google..."
   ❌ "Hope this email finds you well..."

6. **Reference local context (location, competitor, category)**
   "I'm based in Poynton, just down the road from Bramhall..."

7. **One clear CTA per email (micro-offer link or calendar)**
   Don't give multiple options — one clear next step.

8. **UK English spelling and tone (not American)**
   favour (not favor), realise (not realize), colour (not color)

9. **No "hope this email finds you well" or similar clichés**
   Every cold email starts this way. Skip it entirely.

10. **No exclamation marks (feels desperate)**
    Exclamation marks signal over-enthusiasm or desperation. Use periods.

11. **Use short sentences and paragraphs**
    Long sentences are hard to scan. Break things up.

12. **Conversational tone (contractions OK: "I've noticed", "you're")**
    Write how you'd speak. Contractions make it feel human.

13. **Specific over generic ("22 reviews" not "some reviews")**
    Specificity = you've actually looked at their business.

14. **Lead with value/observation, not self-introduction**
    ❌ "Hi, I'm Kobe from Kobestarr Digital..."
    ✅ "I noticed you've only got 8 reviews on Google..."

15. **Reference pain point without stating it explicitly**
    ✅ "...which makes it tough to stand out when someone's comparing local plumbers"
    ❌ "You need more reviews to get more customers"

16. **Subtle barter mentions (if applicable) - natural connection, not pitch**
    ✅ "I'm a regular at coffee shops like yours..."
    ❌ "I'll trade you marketing for coffee"

17. **Social proof via competitor mention (if available)**
    "I helped ABC Plumbing in Stockport go from 12 to 47 reviews..."

18. **Pricing in local currency with proper formatting**
    UK: £97 (not $97), US: $127, AU: A$147

19. **No attachments or links (except micro-offer/calendar)**
    Attachments look spammy. One link maximum.

20. **Sign off casually (just first name, no signature block)**
    ✅ "Kobe"
    ❌ "Best regards, Kobe Starr | Founder & CEO | Kobestarr Digital..."

## Part 3: LinkedIn System — 18 Rules

LinkedIn is different from email — more professional, more public, shorter format.

### The 18 Rules

1. **Connection notes: 1-2 sentences max (LinkedIn limits to 300 chars)**
   You have very limited space. Be concise.

2. **Reference their title/business, not generic "great to connect"**
   ✅ "Saw you're running a salon in Bramhall..."
   ❌ "Would love to connect!"

3. **NO sales pitch in connection note (just context for why connecting)**
   Connection note = context only. Pitch comes later (if at all).

4. **First message (post-connection): 2-3 sentences, reference shared context**
   Once they accept, you can send a proper message.

5. **Offer value (case study, tip, resource) not just "did you see my email?"**
   Don't just reference the email. Offer something new.

6. **Low-pressure CTA (reply/react, not "book a call")**
   ✅ "Let me know if that's useful"
   ❌ "Book a 30-minute discovery call"

7. **UK tone (professional but warm)**
   Less formal than US LinkedIn, but still professional.

8. **No buzzwords ("synergy", "leverage", "circle back")**
   Same as email rule — no corporate jargon.

9. **Different angle than email (don't repeat same hook)**
   **Critical:** If email talked about reviews, LinkedIn should mention a different angle like online booking or Instagram.

10. **Use first name only (no Mr./Ms.)**
    ✅ "Hi Sarah"
    ❌ "Dear Ms. Thompson"

11. **No emojis (feels unprofessional in B2B)**
    Emojis work in B2C, not B2B LinkedIn.

12. **Lead with mutual context (location, industry, observation)**
    "I work with salons in Cheshire..." or "I noticed you're in Bramhall..."

13. **Conversational but not overly casual**
    Warmer than a formal letter, but not as casual as a text message.

14. **One CTA per message**
    Same as email — don't give multiple options.

15. **No attachments in first message**
    Attachments in first DM look spammy.

16. **Reference specific detail from their profile/business**
    Shows you've actually looked at their LinkedIn.

17. **Keep total message under 500 characters**
    LinkedIn is for scanning, not reading essays.

18. **Sign off with just first name**
    ✅ "Kobe"
    ❌ "Best, Kobe Starr"

## Part 4: Category Angles

### 11 Category Groups

Each category has specific pain points and opportunities. Use these angles to make emails feel relevant.

#### 1. TRADESPEOPLE
**Keywords:** plumber, electrician, builder, roofer, carpenter, joiner

**Email Angles:**
- First impression online — most enquiries start with a Google search
- Response time optimization — being first to respond wins the job
- Review generation system — standing out in a crowded market

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Building a pipeline for quieter months — feast or famine problem
- Standing out on Google when everyone looks the same
- Professional brand without looking too corporate

---

#### 2. HEALTH & BEAUTY
**Keywords:** salon, hairdresser, barber, beautician, beauty, spa, massage

**Email Angles:**
- Client retention and rebooking — reducing gaps in schedule
- Online booking friction — "I'll call later" often means never
- Instagram-to-client conversion — turning followers into customers

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Client lifetime value — one client worth £5k+ over 3 years
- Standing out in a saturated market — 20 salons within 2 miles
- Social media that actually books appointments — not just likes

---

#### 3. FOOD & HOSPITALITY
**Keywords:** restaurant, cafe, pub, bar, hotel, catering, bakery

**Email Angles:**
- Table booking optimization — reducing no-shows and filling quiet periods
- Delivery and online presence — capturing takeaway market
- Review response strategy — turning negatives into recovery wins

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Filling quiet periods without discounting — Tuesdays matter too
- Local reputation management — one bad review costs 10 bookings
- Takeaway done right — better than 30% Deliveroo commission

---

#### 4. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
**Keywords:** accountant, solicitor, lawyer, consultant, architect, financial advisor

**Email Angles:**
- Credibility and positioning — standing out as the obvious expert
- Referral system — turning clients into predictable pipeline
- Content marketing — attracting ideal clients with expertise

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Positioning as the obvious expert — not just another accountant
- Referral automation — great work should generate referrals automatically
- Thought leadership without time sink — authority without full-time content creation

---

#### 5. PROPERTY
**Keywords:** estate agent, letting, property management, realtor

**Email Angles:**
- Listing visibility — appearing first when buyers/renters search
- Valuation lead capture — converting visitors into valuation requests
- Landlord retention — keeping landlords loyal with communication

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Listing quality over quantity — 5 great listings beat 20 mediocre
- Valuation conversion — getting the listing, not just the valuation
- Landlord loyalty — one happy investor = all their properties

---

#### 6. FITNESS
**Keywords:** gym, fitness, personal trainer, yoga, pilates, crossfit

**Email Angles:**
- Trial-to-member conversion — turning visitors into committed members
- Class booking optimization — filling classes consistently
- Retention beyond 3 months — reducing drop-off that kills gyms

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Member retention is the entire game — acquiring is expensive, keeping is profitable
- Community over equipment — people stay for culture, not treadmills
- Filling classes without paid ads — organic community growth

---

#### 7. AUTOMOTIVE
**Keywords:** mechanic, garage, car sales, MOT, auto repair, bodyshop

**Email Angles:**
- Service reminder system — bringing customers back before they forget
- Trust building with first-time customers — overcoming "mechanics are dodgy"
- Upsell optimization — increasing job value without feeling pushy

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Customer lifecycle — one customer worth £3k+ over 5 years
- Trust signals that matter — what makes someone trust a new garage?
- Workshop efficiency — more jobs per day without cutting corners

---

#### 8. HOME SERVICES
**Keywords:** cleaner, cleaning, gardener, pest control, removals, handyman

**Email Angles:**
- Recurring booking system — one-off jobs into predictable monthly income
- Quote-to-booking conversion — reducing time between quote and job
- Seasonal demand capture — filling pipeline before quiet months

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Recurring vs one-off — 40 regular clients = peace of mind
- Quote conversion speed — slow to quote = already lost
- Seasonality planning — November is too late to worry about December

---

#### 9. RETAIL
**Keywords:** shop, store, boutique, retail, florist, gift shop

**Email Angles:**
- Foot traffic to website — capturing local customers online
- Local SEO visibility — appearing when locals search for what you sell
- Loyalty and repeat purchase — one-time buyers into regulars

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Local vs online — can't out-Amazon Amazon, but can own local area
- Experience over product — people come for something Amazon can't offer
- Community connection — shops that feel like hubs survive

---

#### 10. EDUCATION
**Keywords:** tutor, music teacher, nursery, childcare, training center, academy

**Email Angles:**
- Enrollment optimization — filling classes faster with clearer path
- Parent communication — reducing admin burden with automation
- Waitlist management — capturing demand even when full

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- Waitlist into enrollment pipeline — "we're full" = future revenue
- Parent experience — happy parents refer other parents (cheapest marketing)
- Class economics — knowing which classes are profitable vs busy

---

#### 11. GENERAL
**Keywords:** Anything uncategorized

**Email Angles:**
- Online presence basics — prospects can find you and understand what you offer
- Review generation — building social proof that converts
- Customer journey optimization — removing friction from contact to purchase

**LinkedIn Angles (different from email):**
- First impressions online — you're being Googled before you exist to them
- Word of mouth at scale — turning great service into predictable referrals
- Small business fundamentals — fail from invisible marketing, not bad work

---

## Part 5: Observation Signals

### 6 Signals with Hooks

**1. lowReviews** (<10 reviews)
**Hook:** "growing your review count"
**Why it matters:** Social proof is critical for local businesses. <10 reviews = struggling to build trust.

**2. noWebsite** (no website listed)
**Hook:** "getting a simple site live"
**Why it matters:** In 2026, not having a website = invisible. Even a basic one-pager helps.

**3. poorWebsite** (has website but outdated)
**Hook:** "refreshing your web presence"
**Why it matters:** Having a bad website can be worse than no website. DIY builders (Wix, Weebly) or no HTTPS = dated.

**4. noSocialMedia** (no Instagram or Facebook)
**Hook:** "building a social presence"
**Why it matters:** For local B2C businesses, social media is where customers engage.

**5. lowRating** (<4.0 rating)
**Hook:** "improving customer experience"
**Why it matters:** Rating below 4.0 = reputation issue. This is urgent.

**6. highReviews** (≥50 reviews)
**Hook:** "capitalizing on your reputation"
**Why it matters:** Positive signal — businesses with strong reputation can leverage it better.

### Signal Priority Order

When multiple signals are detected, use this priority (most urgent first):

1. lowRating (immediate reputation issue)
2. noWebsite (critical missing piece)
3. lowReviews (social proof gap)
4. poorWebsite (needs improvement)
5. noSocialMedia (missing channel)
6. highReviews (positive opportunity)

};

// Connection note (no sales pitch)
const connectionNote = await generateConnectionNote(business);
console.log(connectionNote); // under 300 characters, professional

// First message (after connection accepted)
const message = await generateLinkedInMessage({
  ...business,
  emailSubject: "quick question about your salon",
  emailPrimaryHook: "lowReviews" // Avoid repeating this in LinkedIn
});
console.log(message); // different angle from email, offers value
```

### Example 3: Category Detection

```javascript
const { getCategoryGroup, getCategoryEmailAngles } = require("./category-mapper");

const category = "Plumber";

const business = {
  reviewCount: 8,
  rating: 4.2,
  website: null
};

const signals = computeObservationSignals(business);
console.log(signals); // ["lowReviews", "noWebsite"]

const primary = selectPrimarySignal(signals);
console.log(primary); // "noWebsite" (higher priority)

const hook = getSignalHook(primary);
console.log(hook); // "getting a simple site live"
```
